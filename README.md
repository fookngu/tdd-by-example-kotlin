# Test Driven Development By Example

All source code examples in the repository are for my [Online Course - Testing Spring Beginner to Guru](https://www.udemy.com/testing-spring-boot-beginner-to-guru/?couponCode=GITHUB_REPO)

Examples provided have been inspired by Kent Beck's examples in his book [Test-Driven Development By Example](https://amzn.to/2DTP58p)

In this repository, I look at using Beck's classic TDD Money Example - using Kotlin and JUnit 5.

## Setup

* Should use kotlin 1.4 or higher. Previous versions of Kotlin are un-tested.
* Use Gradle 6.8, other versions are not tested

GitHub Issues will not be addressed.
